# Zelerium
Zelerium is a peer-to-peer digital currency that allows for secure and fast transactions without the need for a centralized authority. It is built on it's own decentralized blockchain and is designed to be used as a means of payment for goods and services.

# How it works
Zelerium uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to secure its network. This means that users who hold Zelerium in their wallets can earn rewards for validating transactions and maintaining the network. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) algorithms used by other digital currencies, PoS requires less computing power, making it more energy-efficient.

Zelerium transactions are validated and recorded on the blockchain, a decentralized ledger that is maintained by all nodes on the network. Each transaction is verified by multiple nodes to ensure that it is legitimate and not a duplicate or fake.
